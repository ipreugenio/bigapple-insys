main() is the function built for the Scheduling system

3 Major Constraints
1. No task for a job can be started until the previous task for that job is completed.
2. A machine can only work on one task at a time.
3. A task, once started, must run to completion.
    - This means that if a task is already running, said task will not adjust for new inputs.

Input = ""
    TODO Machine assignmet, Duration between now() and deadline, filter jobs that are now() - n hours
Output = Updated schedule

2 Levels

Level 1 Solution
Output has minimized production length. Meaning that it takes the minimum amount of time to finish all ongoing jobs.

Level 2 Solution
Input can accept deadlines.

  -Jobs must start after given release dates and be completed before given deadlines
